## Overview
Due to the unavailability of food delivery services like Zomato or Swiggy in my university, I took the initiative to address this issue by developing a Pizza Delivery application using this web application you can order pizza and get pizza within estimated time of 3 Hours.Initially i provided pizza delivery for smvdu students only.I successfully generate a revenue of Rs/- 60000 per month.

## Motivation
Motivation behind making this web application is unavailability of food delivery services like Zomato or Swiggy in my university

## Installation
The Code is written in nodejs . If you don't have nodejs installed you can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you are using a lower version of nodejs you can upgrade using the npm  package manager. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://github.com/AmanMalviya22/pizza/) the repository:
```bash
go to pizza folder and run below command
yarn install || npm install
```

## Deployement on AWS
i successfully deployed this web application on AWS with my free tier account.

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [AWS Documentation](httsps://www.aws.amazon.com) to deploy a web app.
